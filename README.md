# Song Popularity Classification and Content Based Recommendation System

## Project Overview
Wavelengths is a new music streaming company seeking to introduce listeners to the best possible listening experience. They are seeking help in creating a classification system for new music for their listeners based on music popularity. Recommending songs that are popular will likely increase listening time.
