# Song Recommendation System Using Content Based Filtering

by Allison Ward

## Project Overview
Wavelengths is a new music streaming company seeking to introduce listeners to the best possible listening experience. They are seeking help in creating a classification system for new music for their listeners based on music popularity. Recommending songs that are popular will likely increase listening time.
 Additionally, a recommendation system using content-based filtering is established to suggest new songs based on feature similarity.  This provides the listener with a seamless  experience and can also open them up to new artists or songs they have never heard before.
 For a streaming service, these are essential ways to keep listeners on their app and enjoying the songs they love. Increased streaming time will likely increase revenue and customer buy-in for the service, which is essential in todayâ€™s competitive market. 

## Data Overview

The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset. It includes 170,653 Spotify songs, each with quantified audio features such as valence, energy, danceability, tempo, as well as song information such as duration and year released. Songs range from all genres, spanning release years between 1921 to 2020. While the data analyzes Spotify song features, Wavelengths will be able to analyze trends in the data to implement in their own service. 
Limitations of the data include that this is not an official Spotify dataset.

## Content-Based Filtering using Nearest Neighbors

Individual user data was not available, only song features and general popularity. Therefore, the best method to achieve a recommendation system was utilizing content-based filtering, which compares the quality of two items (in this case, songs) and measures the distance between them. The first recommendation system used cosine distance as the method for calculating distance.
